I'm working on a workout tracking app. My issue is that I have an API that brings in over 1300 exercises into 'AdminExerciseManagerView' and from there I select the exercises I want which get saved into Firestore Database. The problem is that when I make selections in 'AdminExerciseManagerView' and then close and reopen my project all the of the selections I made in 'AdminExerciseManagerView' get deselected. I need the selections I make in 'AdminExerciseManagerView' to be able to be saved so I can continue making edits and changes when I reopen the project.
