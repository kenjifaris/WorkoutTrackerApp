1. Progress Tracking with Charts
I’ll integrate SwiftCharts to track user progress (weights and reps) over time for each exercise.
We’ll display this in a dedicated tab in the ExerciseDetailView or as a summary on the ProfileView for overall progress.


2. Calendar View Enhancement
I’ll connect the CalendarView to the workout history, allowing users to click on a date and see what workouts they completed that day.
This will tie into the Firestore data, pulling past workouts dynamically.


3. Smart Workout Plan Generation
In the WorkoutView, I’ll add the logic for creating workout plans based on:
User’s goals (e.g., fat loss, muscle gain)
Workout duration (e.g., 3 months or 1 day quick session)
Muscle group targeting (e.g., "Push", "Pull", "Legs")
The app will be able to generate a workout from these inputs dynamically.


4. Firestore Optimization
I’ll ensure that FirestoreService efficiently handles loading, saving, and editing exercises/workouts.
We’ll make the AdminExerciseManagerView a solid admin tool for managing exercises, and I'll add checks to handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, duplicates).







General UI: Open the app in the simulator and navigate through the different views, such as the workout view, exercise details, and charts. Make sure all buttons and interactions work as expected.

Timer and Workout Title:

Start the workout timer and verify it counts time correctly.
Stop and resume the timer to ensure it functions as expected.
Adding Exercises and Sets:

Add exercises to your workout and make sure they are listed.
For each exercise, add sets and check if the sets are displayed with the correct fields (weight, reps).
Progress Charts:

View the progress chart for each exercise by tapping "Show Progress Chart."
Ensure that the progress data is rendered correctly for the selected exercise.
Swipe-to-Delete:

Swipe left on any set and make sure it can be deleted smoothly. Verify that the deleted set is removed from the view and no errors occur.
Firestore Data:

If you are fetching data from Firestore for progress tracking, ensure the data loads without errors.
Test by adding new progress data and checking if it reflects in the progress chart.
