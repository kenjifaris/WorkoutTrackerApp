1. Progress Tracking with Charts
I’ll integrate SwiftCharts to track user progress (weights and reps) over time for each exercise.
We’ll display this in a dedicated tab in the ExerciseDetailView or as a summary on the ProfileView for overall progress.


2. Calendar View Enhancement
I’ll connect the CalendarView to the workout history, allowing users to click on a date and see what workouts they completed that day.
This will tie into the Firestore data, pulling past workouts dynamically.


3. Smart Workout Plan Generation
In the WorkoutView, I’ll add the logic for creating workout plans based on:
User’s goals (e.g., fat loss, muscle gain)
Workout duration (e.g., 3 months or 1 day quick session)
Muscle group targeting (e.g., "Push", "Pull", "Legs")
The app will be able to generate a workout from these inputs dynamically.


4. Firestore Optimization
I’ll ensure that FirestoreService efficiently handles loading, saving, and editing exercises/workouts.
We’ll make the AdminExerciseManagerView a solid admin tool for managing exercises, and I'll add checks to handle edge cases (e.g., missing data, duplicates).
